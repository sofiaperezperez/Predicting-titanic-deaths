# Predicting-titanic-deaths

The aim of this project is to put into practice all the tools and methods learnt in class, to 
predict the survival or death of people in the Titanic. To do so, we count with several 
variables, ones with more importance than others, that will be used strategically for each 
of the classifiers that have been seen in class in order to get an accuracy for the 
prediction of the survival in each classifier and finally, choose the one which give us the 
best accuracy.
